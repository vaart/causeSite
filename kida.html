I slipped away<br>
I slipped on a little white lie<br><br>

We got heads on sticks<br>
You got ventriloquists<br>
We got heads on sticks<br>
You got ventriloquists<br><br>

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed [x4]<br><br>

Rats and children follow me out of town<br>

Come on kids...

That there, that's not me<br>
I go where I please<br>
I walk through walls<br>
I float down the Liffey<br><br>

I'm not here<br>
This isn't happening<br>
I'm not here, I'm not here<br><br>

In a little while<br>
I'll be gone<br>
The moment's already passed<br>
Yeah, it's gone<br><br>

I'm not here<br>
This isn't happening<br>
I'm not here, I'm not here<br><br>

Strobe lights and blown speakers<br>
Fireworks and hurricanes<br><br>

Flies are buzzing around my head<br>
Vultures circling the dead<br>
Picking up every last crumb<br>
The big fish eat the little ones<br>
The big fish eat the little ones<br>
Not my problem give me some<br><br>

You can try the best you can<br>
If you try the best you can<br>
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic<br>
This one went to market<br>
This one just came out of the swamp<br>
This one dropped a payload<br>
Fodder for the animals<br>
Living on an animal farm<br>

If you try the best you can<br>
If you try the best you can<br>
The best you can is good enough
[x2]<br><br>

I'd really like to help you man<br>
I'd really like to help you man.....<br>
Nervous messed up marionette<br>
Floating around on a prison ship<br><br>

If you try the best you can<br>
If you try the best you can<br>
The best you can is good enough<br>
If you try the best you can<br>
If you try the best you can<br>
Dinosaurs roaming the earth [x3]

I'm the first in the Irish Sea<br>
Another message I can't read<br><br>

I'm on your side<br>
Nowhere to hide<br>
Trapdoors that open<br>
I spiral down<br><br>

You're living in a fantasy world<br>
You're living in a fantasy world<br><br>

I'm lost at sea<br>
Don't bother me<br>
I've lost my way<br>

Red wine and sleeping pills<br>
Help me get back to your arms<br>
Cheap sex and sad films<br>
Help me get where I belong<br><br>

I think you're crazy, maybe<br>
I think you're crazy, maybe<br><br>

Stop sending letters<br>
Letters always get burned<br>
It's not like the movies<br>
They fed us on little white lies<br><br>

I think you're crazy, maybe<br>
I think you're crazy, maybe<br><br>

I will see you in the next life<br><br>

[Early version has a second verse:]<br><br>

Beautiful angel<br>
Pulled apart at birth<br>
Limbless and helpless<br>
I can't even recognize you<br><br>

I think you're crazy, maybe [x6]<br><br>

I will see you in the next life
