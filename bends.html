You can force it but it will not come<br>
You can taste it but it will not form<br>
You can crush it but it's always here<br>
You can crush it but it's always near<br>
Chasing you home saying<br>
Everything is broken<br>
Everyone is broken<br><br>

You can force it but it will stay stung<br>
You can crush it as dry as a bone<br>
You can walk it home straight from school<br>
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules<br>
But still...<br>
Everything is broken<br>
Everyone is broken<br><br>

Everyone is, everyone is broken<br>
Everyone is, everything is broken<br><br>

Why can't you forget?<br>
Why can't you forget?<br>
Why can't you forget?

Where do we go from here?<br>
The words are coming out all weird<br>
Where are you now, when I need you<br>
Alone on an aeroplane<br>
Fall asleep on against the window pane<br>
My blood will thicken<br><br>

I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain<br>
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath<br>
But who are my real friends?<br>
Have they all got the bends?<br>
Am I really sinking this low?<br><br>

My baby's got the bends, oh no<br>
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no<br><br>

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on<br>
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen<br>
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen<br><br>

Where do we go from here?<br>
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear<br>
And where are you?<br>
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines<br>
To blow me away, to blow me sky high<br><br>

My baby's got the bends<br>
We don't have any real friends<br><br>

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on<br>
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen<br>
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen<br><br>

I wanna live, breathe<br>
I wanna be part of the human race<br>
I wanna live, breathe<br>
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race<br><br>

Where do we go from here?<br>
The words are coming out all weird<br>
Where are you now when I need you?

Two jumps in a week<br>
I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy?<br>
Flying on your motorcycle,<br>
Watching all the ground beneath you drop<br>
You'd kill yourself for recognition,<br>
Kill yourself to never ever stop<br>
You broke another mirror,<br>
You're turning into something you are not<br><br>

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br><br>

Drying up in conversation,<br>
You will be the one who cannot talk<br>
All your insides fall to pieces,<br>
You just sit there wishing you could still make love<br>
They're the ones who'll hate you<br>
When you think you've got the world all sussed out<br>
They're the ones who'll spit at you,<br>
You will be the one screaming out<br><br>

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br><br>

It's the best thing that you ever had,<br>
The best thing that you ever, ever had<br>
It's the best thing that you ever had,<br>
The best thing you ever had has gone away<br><br>

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

Her green plastic watering can<br>
For her fake Chinese rubber plant<br>
In the fake plastic earth<br>
That she bought from a rubber man<br>
In a town full of rubber plans<br>
To get rid of itself<br><br>

It wears her out, it wears her out<br>
It wears her out, it wears her out<br><br>

She lives with a broken man<br>
A cracked polystyrene man<br>
Who just crumbles and burns<br>
He used to do surgery<br>
For girls in the eighties<br>
But gravity always wins<br><br>

It wears him out, it wears him out<br>
It wears him out, it wears him out<br><br>

She looks like the real thing<br>
She tastes like the real thing<br>
My fake plastic love<br>
But I can't help the feeling<br>
I could blow through the ceiling<br>
If I just turn and run<br><br>

It wears me out, it wears me out<br>
It wears me out, it wears me out<br><br>

If I could be who you wanted<br>
If I could be who you wanted all the time<br><br>

All the time...<br>

I don't want to be crippled cracked<br>
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back<br>
Ground to dust and ash<br>
Crawling on all fours<br><br>

When you've got to feel it in your bones<br>
When you've got to feel it in your bones<br>

Now I can't climb the stairs<br>
Pieces missing everywhere<br>
Prozak painkillers<br><br>

When you've got to feel it in your bones<br>
When you've got to feel it in your bones<br>
And I used to fly like peter pan<br>
All the children flew when I touched their hands<br><br>

When you've got to feel it in your bones<br>
When you've got to feel it in your bones

They love me like I was a brother<br>
They protect me, listen to me<br>
They dug me my very own garden<br>
Gave me sunshine, made me happy<br><br>

Nice dream, nice dream, nice dream<br><br>

I call up my friend, the good angel<br>
But she's out with her ansaphone<br>
She says she would love to come help but<br>
The sea would electrocute us all<br><br>

Nice dream [x7]<br><br>

If you think that you're strong enough<br>
If you think you belong enough<br>
If you think that you're strong enough<br>
If you think you belong enough<br><br>

Can't get the stink off<br>
He's been hanging round for days<br>
Comes like a comet<br>
Suckered you but not your friends<br>
One day he'll get to you<br>
And teach you how to be a holy cow<br><br>

You do it to yourself, you do<br>
And that's what really hurts<br>
Is that you do it to yourself<br>
Just you and no one else<br>
You do it to yourself<br>
You do it to yourself<br><br>

Don't get my sympathy<br>
Hanging out the 15th floor<br>
You've changed the locks three times<br>
He still comes reeling through the door<br>
One day I'll get you<br>
And teach you how to get to purest hell<br><br>

You do it to yourself, you do<br>
And that's what really hurts<br>
Is that you do it to yourself<br>
Just you, you and no one else<br>
You do it to yourself<br>
You do it to yourself<br><br>

You do it to yourself, you do<br>
And that's what really hurts<br>
Is that you do it to yourself<br>
Just you, you and no one else<br>
You do it to yourself<br>
You do it to yourself.. yourself.. yourself..

Faith, you're driving me away<br>
You do it everyday<br>
You don't mean it<br>
But it hurts like hell<br><br>

My brain says I'm receiving pain<br>
A lack of oxygen<br>
From my life support<br>
My iron lung<br><br>

We're too young to fall asleep<br>
To cynical to speak<br>
We are losing it<br>
Can't you tell?<br><br>

We scratch our eternal itch<br>
A twentieth century bitch<br>
And we are grateful for<br>
Our iron lung<br><br>

The headshrinkers, they want everything<br>
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon<br>
The headshrinkers, they want everything<br>
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon<br><br>

Suck, suck your teenage thumb<br>
Toilet trained and dumb<br>
When the power runs out<br>
We'll just hum<br><br>

This, this is our new song<br>
Just like the last one<br>
A total waste of time<br>
My iron lung<br>
The headshrinkers, they want everything<br>
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon<br>
The headshrinkers, they want everything<br>
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon<br><br>

And if you're frightened<br>
You can be frightened<br>
You can be, it's OK<br>
And if you're frightened<br>
You can be frightened<br>
You can be, it's OK<br><br>

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth<br>
Tearing up inside of me<br>
Every day every hour<br>
I wish that I was bullet proof<br><br>

Wax me<br>
Mould me<br>
Heat the pins and stab them in<br>
You have turned me into this<br>
Just wish that it was bullet proof<br><br>

So pay the money and take a shot<br>
Leadfill the hole in me<br>
I could burst a million bubbles<br>
All surrogate and bullet proof<br><br>

And bullet proof<br>
And bullet proof<br>
And bullet proof

I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown<br>
Well what am I to do?<br>
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you<br>
What are we coming to?<br>
What are we gonna do?<br><br>

Blame it on the black star<br>
Blame it on the falling sky<br>
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home<br><br>

The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you<br>
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you<br>
What are we coming to?<br>
I just don't know anymore<br><br>

Blame it on the black star<br>
Blame it on the falling sky<br>
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home<br><br>

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you<br>
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you<br>
What am I coming to?<br>
I'm gonna melt down<br><br>

Blame it on the black star<br>
Blame it on the falling sky<br>
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home<br>
This is killing me<br>

You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back<br>
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl<br>
You are so pretty when you're on your knees<br>
Disinfected, eager to please<br><br>

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br>
God rest your soul<br>
When the loving comes and we've already gone<br>
Just like your dad, you'll never change<br><br>

Each time it comes it eats me alive<br>
I try to behave but it eats me alive<br>
So I declare a holiday<br>
Fall asleep, drift away<br><br>

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br>
God rest your soul<br>
When the loving comes and we've already gone<br>
Just like your dad, you'll never change<br><br>

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn<br>

Rows of houses, all bearing down on me<br>
I can feel their blue hands touching me<br>
All these things into position<br>
All these things we'll one day swallow whole<br>
And fade out again and fade out<br><br>

This machine will, will not communicate<br>
These thoughts and the strain I am under<br>
Be a world child, form a circle<br>
Before we all go under<br>
And fade out again and fade out again<br><br>

Cracked eggs, dead birds<br>
Scream as they fight for life<br>
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes<br>
All these things into position<br>
All these things we'll one day swallow whole<br>
And fade out again and fade out again<br><br>

Immerse your soul in love<br>
IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE
