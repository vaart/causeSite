After years of waiting nothing came<br>
As your life flashed before your eyes<br>
You realize<br><br>

I'm a reasonable man<br>
Get off, get off, get off my case [x2]<br>
I'm a reasonable man<br>
Get off my case<br>
Get off my case<br><br>

After years of waiting<br>
After years of waiting nothing came<br>
And you realize you're looking,<br>
Looking in the wrong place<br><br>

I'm a reasonable man<br>
Get off my case [x2]<br>
I'm a reasonable man<br>
Get off my case [x2]<br>
I'm a reasonable man<br>
Get off my case [x3]<br><br>

After years of waiting<br>
You're a reasonable man<br>
Get off our case [x3]<br>
I'm a reasonable man,<br>
Get off my case [x3]<br><br>

I'm a reasonable man,<br>
Get off my case [x3]<br>
I'm a reasonable man,<br>
Get off my case [x3]

I jumped in the river and what did I see?<br>
Black-eyed angels swam with me<br>
A moon full of stars and astral cars<br>
All the things I used to see<br>
All my lovers were there with me<br>
All my past and futures<br>
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat<br>
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt<br><br>

There are barn doors<br>
And there are revolving doors<br><br>

Doors on the rudders of big ships<br>
We are revolving doors<br><br>

There are doors that open by themselves<br>
There are sliding doors<br>
And there are secret doors<br><br>

There are doors that lock<br>
And doors that don't<br><br>

There are doors that let you in<br>
And out<br>
But never open<br>
But they are trapdoors<br>
That you can't come back from

Come on, come on<br>
Holy roman empire<br>
Come on if you think<br>
Come on if you think<br>
You can take us all on<br>
You can take us all on<br><br>

You and whose army?<br>

I used to think<br>

There is no future left at all<br>
I used to think<br><br>

Open up, begin again<br>
Let's go down the waterfall<br>
Think about the good times<br>
And never look back<br>
Never look back<br><br>

What would I do?<br>
What would I do?<br>
If I did not have you?<br><br>

Open up, let me in<br>

He's not coming back<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
I'm not coming back<br><br>

So knives out<br>
Catch the mouse<br>
Don't look down<br>
Shove it in your mouth<br><br>

If you'd been a dog<br>
They would've drowned you at birth<br><br>

Look into my eyes<br>
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth<br><br>

So knives out<br>
Cook him up<br>
Squash his head<br>
Put him in the pot<br><br>

I want you to know<br>
He's not coming back<br>
He's bloated and frozen<br>
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste<br><br>

So knives out<br>
Catch the mouse<br>
Squash his head<br>
Put him in the pot

A bump on the head<br>
Coming down the chimney<br>
Release me<br>
Release me<br>
Yeah..<br>
Release me<br>
Release me<br><br>

Where'd you park the car?<br>
Where'd you park the car?<br>
Clothes are all over the furniture<br>
And I might as well<br>

Sleepy jack the fire drill<br>
Run around around around around around..<br><br>

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend<br>
She is papering the window panes<br>
She is putting on a smile<br>
Living in a glass house<br><br>

Once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens<br>
Think of all the starving millions<br>
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones<br>
Your royal highnesses<br><br>

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat<br>
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat<br>
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat<br>
But someone's listening in.<br><br>

Once again, we are hungry for a lynching <br>
That's a strange mistake to make<br>
You should turn the other cheek<br>
Living in a glass house<br><br>

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat<br>
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat<br>
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat<br>
But someone's listening in.
