In the next world war<br>
In a jackknifed juggernaut<br> 
I am born again <br><br>

In the neon sign<br>
Scrolling up and down<br>
I am born again<br><br>

In an interstellar burst<br>
I am back to save the universe<br><br>

In a deep deep sleep of the innocent<br>
I am born again<br><br>

In a fast german car<br>
I'm amazed that I survived<br>
An airbag saved my life<br><br>

In an interstellar burst<br>
I am back to save the universe<br><br>

In an interstellar burst<br>
I am back to save the universe

Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest<br>
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head<br>
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)<br>
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)<br><br>

When I am king, you will be first against the wall<br>
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all<br>
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)<br>
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)<br><br>

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly<br>
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy<br>
You don't remember<br>
You don't remember<br>
Why don't you remember my name?<br>
Off with his head, man<br>
Off with his head, man<br>
Why don't you remember my name?<br>
I guess he does....<br><br>

Rain down, rain down<br>
Come on rain down on me<br>
From a great height<br>
From a great height... height...<br>
Rain down, rain down<br>
Come on rain down on me<br>
From a great height<br>
From a great height... height...<br>
Rain down, rain down<br>
Come on rain down on me<br><br>

That's it, sir<br>
You're leaving<br>
The crackle of pigskin<br>
The dust and the screaming<br>
The yuppies networking<br>
The panic, the vomit<br>
The panic, the vomit<br>
God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!

The breath of the morning<br>
I keep forgetting<br>
The smell of the warm summer air<br><br>

I live in a town<br>
Where you can't smell a thing<br>
You watch your feet<br>
For cracks in the pavement<br><br>

Up above<br>
Aliens hover<br>
Making home movies<br>
For the folks back home<br><br>

Of all these weird creatures<br>
Who lock up their spirits<br>
Drill holes in themselves<br>
And live for their secrets<br><br>

They're all uptight<br>
Uptight.. [x7]<br><br>

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane<br>
Late at night when I'm driving<br>
Take me on board their beautiful ship<br>
Show me the world as I'd love to see it<br><br>

I'd tell all my friends<br>
But they'd never believe<br>
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely<br><br>

I'd show them the stars<br>
And the meaning of life<br>
They'd shut me away<br>
But I'd be all right<br>
All right..<br><br>

I'm just uptight<br>
Uptight.. [x7]

Wake.. from your sleep<br>
The drying of your tears<br>
Today we escape, we escape<br><br>

Pack.. and get dressed<br>
Before your father hears us<br>
Before all hell breaks loose<br><br>

Breathe, keep breathing<br>
Don't lose your nerve<br>
Breathe, keep breathing<br>
I can't do this alone<br><br>

Sing.. us a song<br>
A song to keep us warm<br>
There's such a chill, such a chill<br><br>

You can laugh<br>
A spineless laugh<br>
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you<br>
Now we are one in everlasting peace<br><br>

We hope that you choke, that you choke<br>
We hope that you choke, that you choke<br>
We hope that you choke, that you choke

Transport, motorways and tramlines<br>
Starting and then stopping<br>
Taking off and landing<br>
The emptiest of feelings<br>
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles<br>
And when it comes it's so so disappointing<br><br>

Let down and hanging around<br>
Crushed like a bug in the ground<br>
Let down and hanging around<br><br>

Shell smashed, juices flowing<br>
Wings twitch, legs are going<br>
Don't get sentimental<br>
It always ends up drivel<br><br>

One day I'm going to grow wings<br>
A chemical reaction<br>
Hysterical and useless<br>
Hysterical and ...<br><br>

Let down and hanging around<br>
Crushed like a bug in the ground<br>
Let down and hanging around<br><br>

Let down again<br>
Let down again<br>
Let down again<br><br>

You know, you know where you are with<br>
You know where you are with<br>
Floor collapsing<br>
Floating, bouncing back<br>
And one day....<br>
I am going to grow wings<br>
A chemical reaction<br>
Hysterical and useless<br>
Hysterical and...<br><br>

Let down and hanging around<br>
Crushed like a bug in the ground<br>
Let down and hanging around

Karma police, arrest this man<br>
He talks in maths<br>
He buzzes like a fridge<br>
He's like a detuned radio<br><br>

Karma police, arrest this girl<br>
Her Hitler hairdo is<br>
Making me feel ill<br>
And we have crashed her party<br><br>

This is what you get<br>
This is what you get<br>
This is what you get when you mess with us<br><br>

Karma police<br>
I've given all I can<br>
It's not enough<br>
I've given all I can<br>
But we're still on the payroll<br><br>

This is what you get<br>

Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself<br><br>

I am the key to the lock in your house<br>
That keeps your toys in the basement.<br>
And if you get too far inside<br>
You'll only see my reflection.<br><br>

It's always best when the candle's out,<br>
I am the pick in the ice.<br>
Do not cry out or hit the alarm,<br>
You know we're friends 'til we die.<br><br>

And either way you turn<br>
I'll be there<br>
Open up your skull<br>
I'll be there<br>
Climbing up the walls<br><br>

It's always best when the light is off,<br>
It's always better on the outside.<br>
Fifteen blows to the back of your head,<br>
Fifteen blows to your mind.<br><br>

So lock the kids up safe tonight<br>
And shut the eyes in the cupboard.<br>
I've got the smell of a local man<br>
Who's got the loneliest feeling.<br><br>

That either way he turns - I'll be there<br>
Open up your skull - I'll be there<br>
Climbing up the walls<br><br>

Bruises that won't heal<br><br>

Bring down the government<br>

I'll take a quiet life<br>
A handshake of carbon monoxide<br><br>

No alarms and no surprises<br>

Silent, silent<br><br>

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with<br><br>
