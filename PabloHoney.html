When you were here before<br>
Couldn't look you in the eye<br>
You're just like an angel<br>
Your skin makes me cry<br>
You float like a feather<br>
In a beautiful world<br>
And I wish I was special<br>
You're so fuckin' special<br><br>

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br>
What the hell am I doing here?<br>
I don't belong here.<br><br>

I don't care if it hurts<br>
I want to have control<br>
I want a perfect body<br>
I want a perfect soul<br>
I want you to notice<br>
When I'm not around<br>
You're so fuckin' special<br>
I wish I was special<br><br>

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br>
What the hell am I doing here?<br>
I don't belong here.<br><br>

She's running out again,<br>
She's running out<br>
She's run run run running out...<br><br>

Whatever makes you happy<br>
Whatever you want<br>
You're so fuckin' special<br>
I wish I was special...<br><br>

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,<br>
What the hell am I doing here?<br>
I don't belong here.<br>
I don't belong here.

His banner is twistin'<br>
He knows what he wants<br>
He wants to be looked at<br>
He wants to be loved<br>
He wants us to listen<br>
He wants us to leave<br>
And he was a stupid baby<br>
Turned into a powerful freak<br><br>

How do you?<br>
How do you?<br>
How do you?<br><br>

He's just like his mother<br>
But we showed him respect<br>
He's a dangerous bigot<br>
But we always forget<br>
And he's just like his daddy<br>
Cuz he cheats on his friends<br>
And he steals anybody's<br>
Any way that he can<br><br>

How do you?<br>

And the wise man said "I don't wanna hear your voice"<br>
And the thin man said "I don't wanna hear your voice"<br>
And they're cursing me<br>
And they won't let me be<br>
There's nothing to say<br>
And there's nothing to do<br><br>

Stop whispering, start shouting<br>
Stop whispering, start shouting<br><br>

And my mother said "Let me spit on you son some more"<br>
And the [? building ?] said "Let me spit on your face some more"<br>
And the feeling is<br>
That there's something wrong<br>
Cuz I can't find the words<br>
And I can't find the song<br><br>

Stop whispering, start shouting<br>
Stop whispering, start shouting<br><br>

They said, "I have a complaint<br>
"Can't remember what it is<br>
"That's why I'm here"<br><br>

Been thinking about you, the way I cut your hair<br>
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there<br>
But I'm still no one, and you're my star<br>
What do you care?<br><br>

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest<br>
Should I still love you, still see you in bed<br>
When I'm playing with myself?<br>
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?<br>

All the things you got,<br>
all the things you need<br>
I bought you cigarettes,<br>
and pried the company to come and see you, honey<br><br>

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?<br>
Those people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet<br>
They don't know what I know.<br>
Why should you care when I'm not there?<br><br>

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest<br>
Should I still love you, still see you in bed<br>
When I'm playing with myself?<br>
What do you care when I'm not there?<br><br>

All the things you got<br>
that you'll never need<br>
all the things you got<br>
I bled and I bleed to please you<br><br>

Been thinking about you...

Destiny... destiny protect me from the world<br>
Destiny... hold my hand, protect me from the world<br><br>

Here we are, with our running and confusion<br>
And I don't see no confusion anywhere<br><br>

As the world does turn<br>
And if London burns<br>
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar<br>
I wanna be in a band<br>
When I get to heaven<br>
Anyone can play guitar and there won't<br>
be an [?] anymore<br><br>

Grow my hair... grow my hair I am Jim Morrison<br>
Grow my hair... I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison<br><br>

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys<br>
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed<br>
You feel it till you're dry<br>
You feel it till you've had enough<br>
And you don't understand<br><br>

No Ripcord, no ripcord<br>
No Ripcord, no ripcord<br><br>

Airplane, do I mean what I mean<br>
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh airplane<br><br>

A thousand miles an hour<br>
The politics of power<br>
See you don't understand<br><br>

No Ripcord, no ripcord<br>
No Ripcord, no ripcord<br><br>

I never wanted anything like this<br>
I worked hard, tried hard<br>
I ran around [? a molested place ?]<br>
I fought hard, died long<br><br>

Every time you're running out of here<br>
Every time you're running I get the fear<br><br>

I never wanted any broken bones<br>
Scarred face, no home<br>
Your words surround me and asphyxiate<br>
And I burn all hate<br><br>

Every time you're running out on me<br>
Every time you're running I can see<br><br>

I'm not a vegetable<br>
I will not control myself<br>
I spit on the hand that feeds me<br>
I will not control myself<br><br>

The waters spray, the waters roll all over me<br>
The waters spray, the waters roll on this tired [?]<br><br>

Please forget the words that I just blurted out<br>
It wasn't me, it was a strange and creepy doubt<br><br>

They keep drivin' in my cage<br>
There's nothing in this world to keep the time<br><br>

Even though I might,<br>
Even though I try,<br>
I can't<br><br>

See the things that keep, keep me uninvolved<br>
Silly words that I, that I can't live without<br><br>

If you give up on me now,<br>
I'll be gutted like I've never been before<br><br>

Even though I might,<br>
Even though I try,<br>
